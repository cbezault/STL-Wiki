# September
* Announce this repo at [CppCon 2019](https://cppcon.org/)
* ~~Add initial documentation and build system.~~
* Investigate test harness solutions, either building our own to more closely match the internal system in a reasonable way, or using libcxx's `lit`

# October
* Bring remaining build system components online so that we can shut down the old internal build system.
* Begin auditing and adding test case source files from the `devcrt` test harness.
* Investigate continuous integration options, like GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines.

# November
* [WG21 Belfast Meeting](https://wg21.link/n4814)
