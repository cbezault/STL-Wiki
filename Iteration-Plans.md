# Future
- [ ] `std` test suite running in PRs.
- [ ] `tr1` test suite running in PRs.
- [ ] `libcxx` test suite running in PRs.
- [ ] Bring remaining build system components online so that we can shut down the old internal build system.
- [ ] Enable automatic ingestion of GitHub changes into Visual Studio.
